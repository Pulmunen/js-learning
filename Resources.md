# Learning resources that have helped me to learn JavaScript.

Here are some resources that have helped me to learn JavaScript.  All of them have
at least a small level of interactivity so that you can try stuff out.  None of them actually require a log in to use.

## 1. Scrimba Front End Career Path
https://scrimba.com/path/gfrontend/
This is my main learning resource.


## 2. The Modern JavaScript Tutorial 
https://javascript.info/
Very comprehensive, leaves very few learning gaps.  Includes interactive exercises in a lot of places.

## 3. MDN Front end web developer path
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Front-end_web_developer
Has exercise packages in github for you to follow along and add to.  Also has a forum where you can ask for feedback on exercises, instructions in the pages, although this part will involve signing up.

##  4.W3 Schools
https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp
Good short-form reference, with code editor for trying things out quickly.

## 5. The Khan Academy
https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming
This is a resource made for school aged people, but it's not childish at all.  The JavaScript section starts with a lot of drawing, which aren't essential, but overall the information is presented in a very clear way and there are plenty of interactive exercises.  

## 6.Tutorial republic
https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/
Has both a web tutorial section (again with interactive exercises) and a practice example sections.

## 7. On YouTube: Learn Web Code
https://www.youtube.com/user/LearnWebCode
From absolute zero (so maybe want to fast forward bits), but really easy to understand at a high level. Has really good code alongs.
