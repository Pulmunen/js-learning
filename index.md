# Learning resources that have helped me to learn JavaScript.

Here are some resources that have helped me to learn JavaScript.  All of them have
at least a small level of interactivity so that you can try stuff out.  None of them actually require a log in to use.

## 1. Scrimba Front End Career Path
https://scrimba.com/path/gfrontend/
This is my main learning resource.


## 2. The Modern JavaScript Tutorial 
https://javascript.info/
Very comprehensive, leaves very few learning gaps.  Includes interactive exercises in a lot of places.

## 3. MDN Front end web developer path
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Front-end_web_developer
Has exercise packages in github for you to follow along and add to.  Also has a forum where you can ask for feedback on exercises, instructions in the pages, although this part will involve signing up. This is separate to the MDN reference section, although it is linked from that section.  

##  4.W3 Schools
https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp
Good short-form reference, with code editor for trying things out quickly.

## 5. The Khan Academy
https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming
This is a resource made for school aged people, but it's not childish at all.  The JavaScript section starts with a lot of drawing, which aren't essential, but overall the information is presented in a very clear way and there are plenty of interactive exercises.  Best for: DOM manipulation

## 6.Tutorial republic
https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/
Has both a web tutorial section (again with interactive exercises) and a practice example sections.

## 7. FreeCodeCamp
https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript
Very interactive, no video/audio.  You have to get answers exactly right to progress! Best for: Javascript - ES6, functional programming, OO programming.

## 8. On YouTube: Learn Web Code
https://www.youtube.com/user/LearnWebCode
From absolute zero (so maybe want to fast forward bits), but really easy to understand at a high level. Has really good code alongs.

## 9. On YouTube: Traversy Media
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c&list=PLillGF-RfqbbnEGy3ROiLWk7JMCuSyQtX (JS playlist link)
Brad Traversy sells fully joined up courses on Udemy, but covers individual concepts in freely available YouTube videos.  Best for: all-round guide to developer tasks.  Some individual concepts (components in vanilla JS, JavaScript higher order functions)

## 10. On YouTube: Codevolution
https://codepen.io/Pulmunen/
Sells a Front End developer course, but free YouTube courses are second to none.  Best for: tricker JavaScript concepts (promises), React (full course available for free)
